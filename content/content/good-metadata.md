title: Good metadata
---

## Meta titles (`meta_title`)

- Should describe the mission/course, but in an "exciting" way that uses all possible keywords (machine learning, python, etc)
- Should be less than 68 characters ([ideally 50-60](https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag)), but shorter is more likely to used by Google.
- Anti-patterns for `meta_title`:

	- Avoid using `free`:
		- ~~Dictionaries: Python for Data Science - Free Tutorial~~
		- **Introduction To Dictionaries In Python**
	
	- Choose 1 longer, better flowing phrase over 2 concatenated ones:
		- ~~Multi category chi-squared tests: Probability and Statistics in Python~~
		- **Multi-Category Chi-Squared Tests In Python**

## Meta descriptions (`meta_description`)

For missions:

- First sentence can be a re-hash of the `description` field. Second one should list out concepts / ideas covered ("Includes ...").
- Good example of mission meta description:
	- **Learn about manipulating data in Pandas on a USDA nutritional dataset. Includes transforming columns, normalization, creating columns and sorting dataframes.**

For courses:

- First sentence describe the courses + what it teaches. Second sentence, describe where you'll be after doing the course. third sentence -- describe any projects in the course.
- Good example of course meta description:
	- **Learn Probability and Statistics in Python, including histograms, mean & median, standard deviation, correllation, linear regression, distributions and sampling. By the end, you'll have learned the basics of statistics and linear regression, and performed analysis on real-world datasets, including movie review data.**

## Objectives (`objectives`)

- Should be short, each one being a sentence.
- Should "sell" the course and tell people what they learn
- Should be 2-3 objectives for each mission or course.
- Good example of mission objectives:
	- **How to perform, store, and display arithmetic operators in Python**
	- **Basic programming concepts like variables, functions, methods**
	- **How to work with a simple data set in Python using a list**

## Title (`title`)

- Should describe mission well and be interesting for existing students (more internal focused, less external focused).
