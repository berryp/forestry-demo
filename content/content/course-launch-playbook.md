title: Course launch playbook
---

This course launch playbook contains strategies, checklists, and action items for launching a successful course.  If your course is replacing an existing course, make sure you read the notes about [launching a course rewrite](https://gitlab.dataquest.io/dataquestio/dscontent/wikis/Launching-a-Course-Rewrite)

## Make sure metadata for the new course is high quality:

- Concepts (`dscontent/concepts/{concept_name_plural}`)
- Course and mission level objectives
  - `dscontent/{mission_no}/meta.yml`
  - `dscontent/courses.yml`
- Icon file for new course

## Write a high-quality blog post that previews the content in the course. A good blog post:

- Is interesting to someone who doesn’t necessarily know / care about Dataquest. Some good example of this (keep in mind that this isn’t always possible for blog posts around course launches but use these as inspiration):
  - **How to Generate FiveThirtyEight Graphs in Python:** [https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots/](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots/)
  - **Understanding SettingWithCopy Warning:** [https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/settingwithcopywarning/)
  - **How to get into top 15 of a Kaggle competition:** [https://www.dataquest.io/blog/kaggle-tutorial/](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/kaggle-tutorial/)
- At the end provides a clear idea of what will be covered in the course.

## Promote Blog Post

See [blog marketing playbook](https://gitlab.dataquest.io/dataquestio/dataquest-blog/wikis/Blog-Marketing-Playbook) (may need coordination with marketing).

## Prepare internal messaging:

- When replacing an old course, an Intercom message (email) to notify people of the changes and a link to where they can find the content is helpful.
- When launching new courses, combine into a single Intercom message (email) and describe the courses.

## Coordinate with engineering & marketing to prepare release announcement / newsletter:

Example: [https://www.dataquest.io/blog/whats-new-v1.29/](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/whats-new-v1.29/)

## Follow Up Analytics & Dashboard:

Create a report with queries that track:

- Number of people that viewed the blog post
- Number of people who viewed the course page
- Number of people who attempted a mission
- Etc.
