title: Validating a course
---

Quantitative:
Use Josh’s Kaggle report as a base: [https://modeanalytics.com/editor/dataquest/reports/4b0c25dfcd6e](https://modeanalytics.com/editor/dataquest/reports/4b0c25dfcd6e)

- Understand how many people are interacting with recently released courses.
- Understand where people are getting stuck in a mission.

Qualitative:
- Understand what people are saying they’re getting out of the course (look at Josh's Kaggle report for the query for this)
- Understand where people are getting confused (check Q&A for each mission).
   - Close out any threads in Q&A for each mission that are no longer relevant / cleared up. This can be done from the admin panel (consult with Josh about this, until we can dig up documentation for it).
- Go through content bugs (https://gitlab.dataquest.io/dataquestio/dscontent/issues) and fix any that pertain to your course.

Deliverable:
- Mode report
