## Notes:

- Use specific examples, pain points and build up to more general ideas, over the opposite.
- Always be thinking about the learner’s context
- Whenever possible, show don’t tell
- For beginner content, don’t feel like you always need to explain a concept entirely before letting the learner play. 
  - R / Python Types
    - You can talk about just a few of the key types / as they come up without having to talk about ALL the types and explain all of them
  - Print() function
    - You can talk about `print()` statement as a way of solving specific problem learner is working on without having to exhaustively define what 


## Todo:

## When planning a course, things that you should consider:

- The new superpowers / frameworks we want the learner to have when it comes to working with data
- Starting with a target project and work backwards from there to develop the course’scurriculum
- A visual language for the different concepts

## Ideas for code flow / logic diagrams

- https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/72062/best-way-to-display-code-to-non-programmers

## When introducing a new technique (like pivot table), we want to make sure early that the learner has:

- A clear sense of when that technique would be used
- Easiest way to do this is to show limitation of previous technique when applied to answering a specific question
- A visual picture (whenever possible)
