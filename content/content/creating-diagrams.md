## Introduction

We use vector drawing tools to create diagrams. These tools represent diagrams using the SVG format (scalable vector graphics). This format is similar to HTML and preserves the relationships in the data, allowing the diagrams to work nicely for different resolutions. Spiro uses [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/)  and Srini uses [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). New content creators should use Figma, because we eventually would like to have a team account, add template diagrams, etc.

Create an account at [Figma](http://www.figma.com). Install the Windows / Mac application as well. Open & login to Figma. Click the **+** button to create a new file (or click **File > New File**) . Here’s the Figma help document if you run into any issues: [https://help.figma.com/](https://help.figma.com/) 

## Creating Diagrams

In Figma, you create each part of the diagram, one shape at a time. The 2 tools in the toolbar you’ll use the most are the **Shape Tools** and the **Text Tool.**

If you click the dropdown, you’ll see all of the base shapes you can create. I recommend learning the keyboard shortcuts for Rectangle, Line, and Ellipse, as you’ll use them often:

Let’s create a simple flow diagram.

### Step 1

1. In the following GIF, we use the Rectangle tool to draw a single rectangle. Then, we use **CMD + C** to copy the rectangle, and **CMD + V** to paste the rectangle. The new copy is hidden / overlaps completely with the old rectangle. Hold down **SHIFT** and drag the rectangle to keep it in the relative position (dragging right or left keeps it in the same "row", dragging up and down keeps it in the same “column”). We then use the color panel on the right to choose a Fill color.

2. You’ll notice each object is added to the Layers panel on the left. Layers are a way to group similar objects together, specify which objects should be "in front" of others, etc. You’ll get more familiar with layers as you work with many objects. As you select one / multiple objects, you’ll notice the right panel changing. These are settings specific to just those object(s).

3. We then use the Text tool to add a textbox, and copy the text box.

### Step 2

1. We start by positioning the right textbox and then increasing the font size of both text boxes.

2. We use the Arrow (**SHIFT + L** ) tool to draw an arrow between the rectangles.

3. We add another text box *within* the rectangle. Objects can be nested, grouped together, etc. There’s not many restrictions.
